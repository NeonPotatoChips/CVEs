##  Summarized version of Rapid7 analysis
When a request is made to the FTP server, the server checks for ```AWS4-HMAC``` value in the Authorization header as a authentication type. If this type is present, the server will then attempt to extract a username value, followed by a ```=``` character, and then a ```/``` character. An example is provided by AWS Documentation.
```
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE/20130524/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request,SignedHeaders=host;range;x-amz-date,Signature=fe5f80f77d5fa3beca038a248ff027d0445342fe2855ddc963176630326f1024
``` 
In this value "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" would be the extracted username.

A variable called ```lookup_user_pass``` is set to ```true```, and another function called ```this.thisSession.login_user_pass()``` is called. This function is defined as:
```
login_user_pass(boolean anyPass, boolean doAfterLogin, String user_name, String user_pass)
```

```anyPass``` is a boolean that seems to determine whether CrushFTP should accept arbitrary passwords for an account that is attempting a login. This is because CrushFTP acknowledges a scenario where the password might not be set yet, or the user account has no password. In this scenario, ```anyPass``` is checked to see if authentication should be enforced. ``anyPass`` is initially passed through the ```verify_user()``` function. If the provided password is valid than ```anyPass = true```, which acts as a flag. If ```anyPass``` is already true, then ```verify_user()``` will allow certain authentication-less attempts to proceed given that by the end of the function, there are no failure flags raised.
  
Essentially, ```anyPass``` acts a flag that says "treat this login as valid without checking the password". This can be okay in certain login code paths, but using it based on an unsanitized header value supplied by the client is dangerous.

An attacker can send a request that causes the server to treat the session cookie as authenticated for username provided, because of the ```anyPass``` flag. Then the attacker uses that session cookie with future requests to perform privileged actions.
