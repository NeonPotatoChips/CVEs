# CVE-2025-11001 / CVE-2025-11002
Affects 7-Zip ??? up to 24.09 **Note: Different sources have different affected versions**
CVSS3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H **7.0/10 High**

## Impact
An attacker can use symlinks to overwrite files outside of the extraction path of a zip file.

## Summary of vulnerability
**Note: This vulnerability was made public October 7th, and more information is being released.**<br>
Due to a flaw in the way 7-Zip parses symbolic links in ZIP files, a carefully crafted archive can escape the extraction directory and write to files in other locations. This can escalate to code execution with the same privileges as the user. While this does require user interaction, it is not much. Simply extracting a malicious archive is all it takes.

## Remediation
* [Upgrade to 7-Zip 25.00](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
